First version of data analysis report: 07.12.2022

## 12.12.2022: 

-  Heatmaps in section 12: remove the condition "total expression != 0", show all genes from the list of genes of interest (TLR9 now available).

-  Add differential gene expression analysis of DC1 vs DC2 in LV, PV and all LV + PV samples.

-  generate one more version for the report: replace UMAP by TSNE in all dimension reduction results.

-  Minor modification on figure format, added interactive volcano plot for the DEA of DC1 vs DC2. 


## 09.01.2023:

- Save DE genes of DC1 vs DC2 in all cases to files, use as input to the pathway analysis. 

- Add pathway analysis for DE genes DC1 vs DC2 in all cases. New reports .html added.
